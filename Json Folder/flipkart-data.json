Welcome to the future of future-proof audio.Rail is built with Skull-iQ, a powerful technology that runs innovative voice features and enables new upgrades via the Skull-iQ App. Hands-Free Voice Controls are available in multiple languages. By simply starting a prompt with �Hey Skullcandy�,'' you can control media players, summon your assistant (including Alexa and iHeart), access Spotify� or even take a photo.Rail delivers big, detailed sound with premium drivers and ergonomically designed ear gels for a super-comfortable, noise-isolating fit. Personal Sound by Mimi fine-tunes the sound to your individual hearing, and Clear Voice Smart Mic uses artificial intelligence to isolate your voice and reduce background noise.Multipoint Pairing makes it possible to pair your earbuds to two devices at once, so if your phone rings while you're watching a movie on your laptop, your connection will automatically switch so you can take the call. Rail also comes with Tile finding technology built-in. If an earbud is misplaced, you can just ring'it from the free Tile app.",
